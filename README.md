This folder contains some of the files that I used for the NAMD tutorial

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKAMRMigmvU

I have included the
1) Topology file
2) Parameter file
3) PDB file

Instructions are given in the video to create the NAMD script used for energy minimization, equilibration and NVT simulations.
